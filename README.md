## Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (pnpm is recommended):**
    *Ensure you have pnpm installed. If not, see [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation).*
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Trigger the data scan:**
    To generate the data, make a `GET` request to the scan API endpoint. You can do this by visiting `http://localhost:3000/api/scan` in your browser. The scan will run in the background on the server. The frontend will automatically poll for the data and display it when ready.
